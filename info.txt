Project aim: rendering in 3D heat flux anomalies maps.

Original data (to be rendered):
./UFZ_RemoteSensing/

Example of a rendering - to make something silimar to this:

The idea would be to show these monthly latent heat flux anomalies in 3d from 2001 to 2012 like in the video. 
It would be nice if we can add some information about events that happened over this period of time, for example:
    2003 Drying trend in June (positive anomaly) followed by the July-August heat wave (negative anomalies) in western Europe
    2005 Drought in the Iberian Peninsula over the whole year (negative anomalies)
    2007 Heatwave in Italy, Greece and Turkey in July-August (negative anomalies)
    2010 positive anomaly during the heatwave of Eastern Europe in July
